Instead of bundling all the binary packages for the tools into this folder.
We'll just catalog what is being used.
Each project work station will need to get configured with these tools.

0.		GitHub - The latest GitHubSetup package.
0a.		Git - I also put the latest Git down.  I did this before installing the GitHubSetup.
